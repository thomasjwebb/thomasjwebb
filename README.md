### 🦇 Music

I am a drummer, synth player and composer. I am a [certified Bitwig instructor](https://www.bitwig.com/en/community/certified/thomas-webb.html) and have made a [🎹 controller script](https://github.com/osakared/apc-key-25-bitwig) for it. I can also instruct on sound design, how synthesizers (of all types) work, etc. I also record music sometimes, [💿 check out my recent release](https://fanlink.to/werewolf-of-paris).
