### About

(wip, I'm saving this and playing around so it's gonna look weird today -tjw)

I'm a software engineer. I consult through [Osaka Red LLC](https://osakared.io).

I blog on tech stuff [here](https://webbmaster.com).

I'm behind the open source haxe audio libs [haxe grig](https://gitlab.com/haxe-grig), plus some other stuff.

I know a lot of languages well so I'll just list a few that I either *like a lot* or *use a lot*: C, C++, haxe, rust, python, ruby, javascript.

I'm into audio programming, machine learning, server, client, web, hit me up if you have similar interests. Some places I can be reached:
