### About

(wip, I'm saving this and playing around so it's gonna look weird today -tjw)

I'm a software engineer. I consult through [Osaka Red LLC](https://osakared.io).

I blog on tech stuff [here](https://webbmaster.com).

I'm behind the open source haxe audio libs [haxe grig](https://gitlab.com/haxe-grig), plus some other stuff.

I know a lot of languages well so I'll just list a few that I either *like a lot* or *use a lot*: C, C++, haxe, rust, python, ruby, javascript.

I'm into audio programming, machine learning, server, client, web, hit me up if you have similar interests. Some places I can be reached:

### 🍺 Homebrewing

I do small batches of all-grain brewing. See my recipes [here](https://snowplant.org/) and also the [profile on untappd](https://untappd.com/SnowPlant).

### 🥙 Cooking

Check out some vegan recipes in [this repo](https://github.com/thomasjwebb/recipes) also check out [this ig](https://www.instagram.com/shallotsanctuary/) and my occasional [food booth](https://panella.place/).

### 🦇 Music

I am a drummer, synth player and composer. I am a [certified Bitwig instructor](https://www.bitwig.com/en/community/certified/thomas-webb.html) and have made a [🎹 controller script](https://github.com/osakared/apc-key-25-bitwig) for it. I can also instruct on sound design, how synthesizers (of all types) work, etc. I also record music sometimes, [💿 check out my recent release](https://fanlink.to/werewolf-of-paris).
